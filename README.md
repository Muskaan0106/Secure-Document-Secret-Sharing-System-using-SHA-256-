# Document Secret Sharing (DSS) with SHA-256 Authentication
## A robust Python-based implementation of Shamir’s $(k, n)$ Secret Sharing Scheme designed specifically for documents. This system ensures high confidentiality by splitting files into multiple shares and guarantees integrity through individual share authentication using SHA-256 hashing11111111.🚀 FeaturesThreshold Cryptography: Securely split documents into $n$ shares where at least $k$ shares are required for reconstruction2222.Integrity Verification: Every share is individually hashed using SHA-256 to detect tampering before reconstruction3333.Format Agnostic: Successfully tested with PDF, Image, Word (DOCX), and PowerPoint (PPTX) files4444.User-Friendly GUI: A built-in Tkinter interface for easy share generation and file recovery555555555.Performance: Reconstruction typically occurs in under 2 seconds for files up to 5 MB66666.🛠️ System ArchitectureThe project is divided into three core modules7777:Share Generator (part1_generator.py): Converts documents into 132-byte binary chunks, generates random polynomials, and creates authenticated shares8888.Share Reconstructor (part2_reconstructor.py): Validates shares against stored hashes and applies Lagrange Interpolation to recover the original document9.GUI Launcher (gui_launcher.py): Provides a notebook-style interface to manage both generation and reconstruction tasks10.📦 InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-sharing-tool.git
cd secret-sharing-tool
Install dependencies:This project requires the pycryptodome library for prime number generation.Bashpip install pycryptodome
🖥️ UsageUsing the GUIRun the main launcher to start the application:Bashpython gui_launcher.py
To Generate: Go to the "Generate Shares" tab, select your input file, choose a destination folder, and set your $n$ (total shares) and $k$ (threshold) values11.To Reconstruct: Go to the "Reconstruct File" tab, select the directory containing the .txt shares and metadata, and specify your output path12121212.Using Command LineGeneration:Bashpython part1_generator.py <input_file> <output_dir> <num_shares> <threshold>
Reconstruction:Bashpython part2_reconstructor.py <input_dir> <output_file> <num_shares> <threshold>
📊 Experimental ResultsThe system maintains a low storage overhead and high accuracy1313131313:Accuracy: 100% bit-level identical reconstruction14141414.Overhead: Minimal share size increase (approx. 4% – 5.5%) due to metadata and hashing151515151515151515.Security: Successfully rejects tampered shares via hash-mismatch detection16161616.📄 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
